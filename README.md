# Warning! : This Tool Was Made for education Purpose

# Please remember that selfbots arent fully suported by Discord and that it should only be used to make YOUR life easier and not others. Also keep in mind that discord has a set of rules regarding selfbots:
# A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, act like a normal bot (responding to user commands, etc)
# A selfbot must not, under any circumstance, do "invite scraping". This is the action of detecting server invites in chat, and automatically joining a server using that invite.
# As selfbots run under your account they are subject to the same Terms of Service. Meaning they should not spam, insult or demean others, post NSFW material, spread viruses or illegal material, etc. They have to follow the same rules that you follow.
# Abusing the API such as spamming users, or spamming the API itself can and will cause your account to be banned
# Discord does not 'support' self bots. ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
# IF, and only if you accept the above rules of selfbots, then you may proceed. You might get warned but it appears it's just a ban if caught. Good luck, soldiers.

# use it at your own risk! Soldiers.
